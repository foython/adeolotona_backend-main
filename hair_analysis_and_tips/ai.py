    Use the images to infer hair type, length, health, and condition as much as possible. Use the user_data for any additional info or to help make assumptions if images are ambiguous.
    Your answer must strictly follow the JSON format above.
    Do not ever output a string for 'tips', only a JSON list.
    Never return more than one answerâ€”just the JSON object, nothing else.
